function [value, isterminal, direction] = termination_event(t,y)
%TERMINATION_EVENT determines termination event for solving the ode
%   The ode solver has to stop solving as soon as the robot is about to 
%   take off, at this point the dynamics change and a different ODE has to
%   solved. This function will determine when the termination has to occur
